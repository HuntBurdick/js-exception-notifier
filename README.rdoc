= JsExceptionNotifier
The JsExceptionNotifier gem detects JS exceptions with TraceKit and sends notifications via email using Exception Notification gem.
The TraceKit is attached by default.

== Requirements
- Ruby 2.0.0 or greater
- Rails 4.0 or greater
- Exception Notification gem
- TraceKit(included in package)

== Getting Started
Add the following line to your application's Gemfile:

  gem "js_exception_notifier", :git => "git://github.com/shorelabs/js-exception-notifier.git"

Thatâ€™s it, the configuration ends up here.

== Usage

Add the following line at the beginning of the javascript file

  javascript_include_tag "js_exception_notifier.js"

Or just include files within the asset pipeline:

  //= require js_exception_notifier

=== Usage when serving JS from CDN

Due to a potential security issue, browsers traditionally don't provide access to error data if the script violates the same-origin policy. Instead, browsers just report a meaningless Script error on line 0, with no additional data.

If you are serving your javascript assets through a CDN (Cloudfront for eg), you need to 
* have HTTP CORS headers (not covered here)
* load your JS with a +crossorigin+ tag to enable error reporting

The latter is done with

  javascript_include_tag "js_exception_notifier.js", crossorigin: 'anonymous' 

Or if js_exception_notifier is added to the asset pipeline

  javascript_include_tag "application", crossorigin: 'anonymous'

== JsExceptionNotifier comes with a dummy app:

  bundle
  cd test/dummy && rails s
